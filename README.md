# getImageUrl
This is a repo with a mixin for a problem experienced by Vue developers mostly, So to render dynamically images on the DOM but the src attr on the img tag cannnot be automatically binded, so use the function in the repo as a mixin in Vue to display the images by using meta.url, The imageUrl parameter specifies the image name and the path parameter can be configured to specify different levels of nesting in the project.
ENJOY!!!
